\section{Introduction}

The format of this template follows the typical journal publication which includes an \textbf{abstract} for summarizing the article, an \textbf{introduction}, \textbf{results} and \textbf{conclusion}. Examples of an \textbf{equation}, \textbf{list} and \textbf{citation} are also included.

\subsection{The purpose of the introduction}

Most academic introductions follow an ‘inverted pyramid’ structure: they start broad and narrow down to a specific thesis or research question.
The introduction should reveal

\begin{enumerate}
\item some broad knowledge of the overall topic
\item references to related and prior work in the field of investigation
\item succinct overview of the major point of the paper.
\end{enumerate}
